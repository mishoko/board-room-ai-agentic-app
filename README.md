## What It Is

**AI Agentic Boardroom** is a cutting-edge simulation platform that creates realistic C-level executive discussions using advanced AI agents. Unlike traditional chatbots, our agents exhibit **emergent behavior**, **challenge each other**, and provide **contextually-aware strategic insights** that mirror real boardroom dynamics.

### Advanced Features

- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Agents interact naturally without central orchestration
- **Real-time LLM Integration**: Powered by local Ollama or OpenRouter AI for privacy and performance
- **Dynamic Personality System**: Agents can be challenging, salty, or supportive based on conversation context
- **Adaptive Timing**: Smart conversation pacing based on meeting duration and urgency
- **Emergent Behavior**: Conversations develop organically with surprising insights
- **User Interruption Handling**: Non-blocking real-time user input integration
- **Contextual Memory**: Agents remember everything said and adapt accordingly. Full conversation history and user input awareness

---

### ü§ñ Agentic AI System Highlights

```typescript
// Each agent is an autonomous entity with:
- Unique personality and expertise
- Memory of full conversation history
- Ability to challenge and disagree
- Context-aware response generation
- Real-time LLM integration
```

### Modern Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom glassmorphism components
- **AI**: Local Ollama integration (even small models like llama3.2:latest) or OpenRouter AI
- **State Management**: Custom boardroom state manager
- **Architecture**: Component-based with service layer separation

## Quick Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+
- **Ollama** installed and running OR **OpenRouter AI** API key
- **llama3.2:latest** (or smarter) model downloaded for local Ollama instance

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-agentic-boardroom
cd ai-agentic-boardroom

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start Ollama (if using local LLM)
ollama serve

# Download the model (if not already downloaded)
ollama pull llama3.2:latest

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file or copy from `.env.example`:

```env
# LLM Provider Selection (openai | ollama)
VITE_LLM_PROVIDER=openai

# OpenRouter AI (recommended) or OpenAI API
VITE_LLM_API_KEY=your_openrouter_or_openai_api_key_here
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openrouter_or_openai_api_key_here

# Local Ollama Configuration
VITE_OLLAMA_URL=http://localhost:11434
VITE_OLLAMA_MODEL=llama3.2:latest

# Default AI Model for Agents (for OpenRouter)
VITE_DEFAULT_AI_MODEL=google/gemma-3-27b-it:free
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Note**: The `openai` provider setting is optimized for **OpenRouter AI**, which provides an OpenAI-compatible API with access to multiple models. Direct OpenAI API integration is also supported but primarily tested with OpenRouter.

---

## How It Works

1. **Company Setup**: Define your company context, industry, and stage
2. **Executive Selection**: Choose your C-level team from available agents
3. **Topic Configuration**: Set discussion topics with priorities and durations
4. **Real-time Simulation**: Watch AI agents engage in strategic discussions
5. **Interactive Participation**: Interrupt and guide conversations in real-time

### Agent Behavior Examples

- **Challenging**: _"I fundamentally disagree with this financial framework..."_
- **Salty**: _"These ROI calculations are embarrassingly simplistic..."_
- **Strategic**: _"The market dynamics suggest we're at an inflection point..."_
- **Contextual**: Agents reference previous statements and user input

---

## Technical Highlights

### AI Integration

- **Local LLM**: Privacy-focused with Ollama integration
- **OpenRouter AI**: Access to multiple models via OpenAI-compatible API
- **Context Awareness**: Full conversation history in every request
- **Fallback System**: Graceful degradation when LLM unavailable
- **Real-time Generation**: No pre-computed responses

### User Experience

- **Glassmorphism Design**: Modern, professional aesthetic
- **Multi-part Messages**: Long agent responses split into digestible parts
- **Hover Controls**: Pause conversations to read full messages
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliant with keyboard navigation

---

## Future Roadmap
